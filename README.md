# Atlas

Atlas is a social mapping app that lets you post geolocated notes on the Fediverse.  It is built on top of the [Emissary](https://emissary.dev) server, so Atlas' [ActivityPub Federation](https://github.com/EmissarySocial/emissary/blob/main/FEDERATION.md) model is determined by Emissary, and it shares many other common features with other Emissary apps.
