# About Atlas

Atlas is a global, Federated map, where you can drop notes for other Fedizens that are connected to specific places on our pale blue dot.  Here's a quick guide to get you started:

## Setup
For Atlas to run properly, you'll need to set up number of third party geocoding services.  Please [follow all of the steps in the setup checklist &nearr;](https://github.com/EmissarySocial/atlas/wiki/Setup-Checklist) when you're evaluating this theme.

## Atlas Tour

### Placemarks
Posts on an Atlas server are **called Placemarks** because they also include geolocation information, so they display with a map where the note is pinned.  Like many other Fediverse apps, you can **create** and **tag** and **attach images** to them as well.  Placemarks work just like toots, so you can share, like, and reply to them everywhere on the Fediverse.

### Local-First Search
The Placemarks on a server show up in a server-wide map.  Visitors can zoom the map down to the locations they're interested in, then search their local area using **hashtags**. 

### Federated Search Engine
Atlas servers are meant to work in groups, with each server subscribing to the search results discovered by others in its group. So, communities can join together to share their location data with other allied servers 

### Mobile Theme
Atlas is a simple mobile website that is meant to be used on a mobile phone. So, the Atlas theme puts an emphasis on mobile usability.  There's also a perfectly fine theme for larger devices, but we're putting extra attention into delivering a first-rate mobile experience.

### Search Results In Your Inbox
Soon, visitors will be able to follow the search results from an Atlas server just like they can with other Emissary apps. This will roll out along with some engineering updates to the search engine to make it deliver results faster, and to make it location-aware.


## Roadmap
Here's what we're working on for future versions of this app:

* **Follow Search Results** - visitors can receive updated search results in their Fediverse inboxes.
* **Real-Time Improvements** - We are working ways to make Atlas respond to changing events in real time.  We'll be speeding up Emissary's search engine to send search notifications in real time, and providing real-time discussion notifications when others reply to Atlas placemarks.
* **Share via QR-Codes** - facilitate in-person sharing with QR codes for posts and search results.
* **Improved Attachments** - improve the number and kinds of photo attachments.
